READ ME FOR CAR SALE GUI BY ANTONIO ROMEU



I tried adding arrays in and I correctly defined them and everything and my teacher helped me add them into 
the ComboBox but I am now having trouble getting the all(); function to execute properly outside of ComboBoxModel.
I tried commenting out the all(); functins for a couple of the functions but it doesn't seem to work, as well as I can't seem to figure out
how to get rid of the old functions I used to test out some of the always executing functions, and I ended up going with mouse entered functions
for both the panel and the txtAreaReceipt so it executed every time the mouse moved basically, as a way of getting it to calculate on startup and to 
keep on executing. Maybe I could try a Thread.sleep(400); or something, that way it isn't so intensive on the computer. But that would still need some
sort of input from the user, whether it be a mouse movement or what, but that's what I'm trying to eliminate.

Anyways, this is the current state of the file, not so great. But if you have any suggestions, email them to me: antonio.r.romeu@gmail.com
